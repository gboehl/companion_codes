This folder contains a collection of models that can be used with `pydsge`. The models are:

* `bgs_het.yaml`: the baseline model from Boehl, Goy & Strobel (A Structural Investigation on Quantitative Easing)
* `bgs_h2m.yaml`: the baseline model from Boehl, Goy & Strobel (A Structural Investigation on Quantitative Easing) with hand-to-mouth agents
* `bgs_rnk.yaml`: the baseline model from Boehl, Goy & Strobel (A Structural Investigation on Quantitative Easing) without borrowing and lending households (RANK)
* `rank.yaml`: the Smets-Wouters model
* `tank.yaml`: the Smets-Wouters model with hand-to-mouth agents
* `frank.yaml`: the Smets-Wouters model with BGG-type financial frictions
* `ftank.yaml`: the Smets-Wouters model with hand-to-mouth agent and BGG-type financial frictions
* `cfp_qe.yaml`: An adapted version of the model from Carlstrom, Fuerst & Paustian (2017) adapted for estimation with ZLB and QE. See Boehl, Goy & Strobel for details.
* `nk.yaml`: the generic 3-equations benchmark NK model
* `minimal_nk.yaml`: the most minimal version of the generic 3-equations benchmark NK model
* `fnk.yaml`: a 3-equations benchmark NK model with financial frictions (model from Boehl & Lieberknecht: The Hockey Stick Phillips Curve and the Zero Lower Bound)
* `dfi.yaml`: another 3-equations benchmark NK model with financial frictions (model from Boehl: Monetary Policy and Speculative Asset Markets). The file contains many comments and serves as an example
